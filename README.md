# Electricity-and-Magnetism-Calculators
A collection of Electricity and Magnetism calculators and plotting apps with GUI's. These were done as labs for PHY 367 / EGR 367

Each program has an exe that allows them to run without Python (I hope!) and more importantly ensures that all the files are together and the correct main file is ran instead of one of the other modules. If you want the exe just email me! kedreeant@gmail.com or kedreep@umich.edu
